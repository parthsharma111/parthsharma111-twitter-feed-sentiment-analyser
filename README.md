# twitter-feed-sentiment-analyser
This is the SD project (CS575)
I have implemented Naive bayes clasifier for sentiment analysis of twitter feed. The input is a word and the output is list of tweets containing that word, classified as eithre positive, negative or neutral.

This is implememted using Python with Flask Framework.

To execute the system should have python 2.7 and flask as well as twitter packages
To install flask==>  pip install flask

To install twitter package==> pip install twitter

To execute==> python app.py


Thank you
